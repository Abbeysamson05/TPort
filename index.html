      <h4>Never Coded Before? Not a problem.</h4>
      <p>
        From walking to reading, every skill takes time to acquire. Coding
        software isn't different. Time and effort is all you need and we're here
        show you the way by:
      </p>
      <p>Build real projects built step-by-step.</p>
      <p>
        Technology has made the 21st century, the century of the entrepreneur.
        Thanks to the power of the internet, you can reach a global audience in
        minutes.
      </p>
      <p>
        If you're starting (or have started) a business in today's tech driven
        economy, then you need to understand the code that's driving your
        business.
      </p>
      <p>
        Imagine not knowing the time and effort involved in realizing your idea?
      </p>
      <p>
        Imagine having an incredible idea but you don't have the skills to get
        it started?
      </p>
      <h4>1. Top Down, Not Bottom Up</h4>
      <p>
        Our approach is simple and the opposite of how school typically works.
      </p>
      <p>
        Build something real first, then uncover why each piece works the way it
        does.
      </p>
      <p>And not the other way around.</p>
      <p>
        You see, this method allows you to start to gain confidence as well as
        helps you formulate questions like:
      </p>
      <p>or</p>
      <blockquote>
        <em>"How can I scrape this webpage every day to track changes?"</em>
      </blockquote>
      <p>or</p>
      <blockquote>
        <em>"How do I save this data to a group of users?"</em>
      </blockquote>
      <p>Questions build a deeper understanding</p>

      <p>because they force you to think in a different way.</p>

      <p>
        Your public questions will force you to be clear and often solve
        themselves for that very same reason. This statement, of course, won't
        make sense until it happens to you.
      </p>

      <p>It's often that questions are more important answers.</p>
      <h4>Coding is Ideas in Action 24/7/365</h4>
      <p>
        And it's is extremely logical. Take Python for example - it reads just
        like the English language less a couple of odd characters (if it doesn't
        now, it will soon):
      </p>
      <p>
        Can you read it? Sure you can. Do you understand it? Not yet... But you
        will.

            2. I am not technical at all, are you sure I should enroll to Coding
            For Entrepreneurs?
          </h4>
          <p>
            There was a time you didn't know how to read, or write, or speak, or
            walk, or... I believe you are not technical because you didn't take
            the time to learn through the hard times OR because you haven't even
            tried OR the class you took, started with the wrong things.

          <h4>3. Why don't I just find a partner or hire a developer?</h4>
          <p>
            Coding software is about breaking your ideas into rules or steps
            that a computer can follow. If you don't know how to write these
            rules or be clear about writing them, a lot (I mean a lot) of time,
            money, and resources can be wasted. You don't know what you don't
            know. Restaurant owners might be able to hire chefs to cook food for
            them, but if you've never eaten food, how would you know you have a
            good chef or if your food is good? This question becomes much more
            difficult to answer once your project starts to scale.
          </p>

          <p>
            Learning to code is learning to think systemically, logically, and
            clearly. Being able to code means you'll be able to test ideas
            rapidly to focus on the things you want to build.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <h4>Why don't I just use Wordpress or another platform?</h4>
          <p>
            This is like asking a chef why he doesn't follow someone else's
            recipe. The other recipe might be fantastic... but it's still
            following a recipe. A true chef creates. A cook follows. Using a
            platform can be great...but to truly innovate, you need to know how
            to do it yourself.
          </p>

          <p>
            Another way to think of this is how rapidly technology can change.
            If you can't adapt to radical technology change, you'll be trying to
            run a fast food joint over a single outdoor campfire.
